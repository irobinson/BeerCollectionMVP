This is a sample application used to demonstrate concepts/tools brought up in my unit testing presentation (WebFormsMVP, IOC w/ DNN's SimpleContainer, MOQ, MBunit).

In addition, I've recently expanded the module to be a proof in concept for using StringTemplate as a DNN module templating engine.
It uses MSBuild scripts to build installable DNN module packages when in release mode. You'll need the MSBuild Community Tasks installed for that to work.

Please review the slide deck PDF and also let me know if you would like to discuss.
